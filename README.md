# Maze Thief
A 3D MazeRunner game created with Unity.

## How to play:
The player starts at a portal in one corner of the maze. He must search for the treasure, a battery placed somewhere inside, collect it, and get back to his starting portal before the timer runs out. If he makes it back in time, he scores one point. Each time a point is scored, positions reset and the player tries again, with the timer reduced by 10 seconds. If the player fails to make it in time, his score resets and he starts with the original time limit again. 

There is also a guard who is released 20 seconds after the start of the game, who will chase the player. If the player is caught, the game restarts.

## Features:
- Procedural maze generation, different every time
- AI guard who chases you at a walking speed, once he is near you and can see you, he switches to a run and is faster than you
- The player can find a stun gun somewhere in the maze, if he uses it to shoot the guard, the guard slows down and cannot catch the player

None of the assets are mine, I used free assets available in the Unity asset store, as well as SFX available for free on different websites.
